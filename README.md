# rocket-flight-simulator

A Simulink project which can accurately simulate the motion of a rocket during flight in one-dimensional space. The project implements the forces acting on a rocket which are drag, weight, and thrust as subsystems that take time-variant parameters into consideration such as mass of the rocket, distance to Earth, and air density at different layers of Earth's atmosphere. As output, the project plots the position-time, velocity-time, and acceleration-time graphs of the rocket.



## Run on terminal

```sh
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run('param.m');exit;"
```
